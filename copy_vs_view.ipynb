Let's see how long NumPy's transpose function takes, by transposing a huge (10000 âœ• 10000) matrix. This time, let's exclude the time it takes to allocate this beast of a matrix and focus solely on the [np.transpose](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.transpose.html) function:"
