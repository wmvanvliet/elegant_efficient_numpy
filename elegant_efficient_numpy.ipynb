    "# Elegant and efficient NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is for those who have clobbered together an analysis script or two, using basic Python and NumPy, and want to learn how to write more elegant and efficient analysis code. We will dive into how NumPy works behind the scenes and use this knowledge to our advantage. This tutorial also serves as an introduction to reading the definitive work on this topic: [Guide to NumPy](http://web.mit.edu/dvp/Public/numpybook.pdf) by Travis E. Oliphant, the initial creator of NumPy."
